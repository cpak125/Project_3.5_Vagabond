# Project Vagabond<br>

For project 3.5, we created a travel app that lets users post their experience when visiting a city.

-When a user navigates to the landing page, he/she will be greeted with a slideshow of all of the cities you can make posts about.
And below the slideshow are clickable cards containing each city.

-Once the user clicks on one of the cards they are taken to that specific city page where there is a photo of the city that they want to make a post about.

-When the user clicks the ‘Add New Post button’, a form will pop up where they can add the Title and the Body of the post, and below the form is a ‘Submit’ button. Once the user clicks the ‘Submit’ button the post is then created.

-When a user clicks on their post they will be taken to the ‘posts’ page. On the ‘posts’ page they’ll be able to edit or delete the post that they clicked on. The ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’ buttons are below the post.

-When the user clicks the ‘Edit’ button a blank form will appear where they can edit the post.
When the user clicks the ‘Delete’ button a modal box will appear saying, “Are You Sure You Want To Delete”. And if you click thr red ‘OK’ button, a modal box will appear letting you know that the deletion was a success.
